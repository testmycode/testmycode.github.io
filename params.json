{"name":"TestMyCode","tagline":"","body":"### Contributing to TestMyCode repositories\r\n\r\n1. Find the correct [repository](https://github.com/testmycode) or repositories.\r\n2. Create an issue and briefly outline your plan before starting work on a patch. We'll do our best to comment in a timely manner.\r\n3. Set up a development environment as described in each projects README file. All products can be developed with the latest Ubuntu LTS. Other distros may require some fiddling. Root permissions are required for some things.\r\n4. Create a branch for your fix or feature. We prefer descriptive branch names.\r\n5. Write the code and tests.\r\n6. *Remember to run entire test suite before submitting a pull request.* (We know it takes ages to run but it does catch a lot of bugs.)\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to submit your pull request early for feedback,\r\nor just link to your branch in an issue comment. Please try to do large changes\r\nin smaller iterations and have code reviewed and merged at reasonable checkpoints.\r\n\r\n### Coding conventions\r\n\r\nMostly just try to stick to the style you see used in the project.\r\n\r\n#### Ruby\r\n* Indentation: two spaces, no tabs.\r\n* No trailing whitespace, even on blank lines.\r\n* Indent before private/protected.\r\n* Use Ruby >= 1.9 syntax for hashes. Prefer { a: :b } over { :a => :b }.\r\n* Prefer `&&` and `||` over `and` and `or`.\r\n* Prefer `extend self` over `def self.method` for modules.\r\n* Write method calls like `foo(bar, baz)` (parenthesis may be omitted in very clear cases, but it is not required)\r\n* Spaces around operators: `a = b + c`, not `a=b+c`.\r\n* Single-line blocks should use braces like this: `foo {|x| stuff(x) }`.\r\n* Multiline blocks should use `do |x|` syntax.\r\n\r\n#### Java\r\n* Indentation: four spaces, no tabs.\r\n* No trailing whitespace, even on blank lines.\r\n* No blank lines after method definitions ifs, whiles etc.\r\n* No unnecessary final attributes inside methods or for parameters\r\n* Method calls have no space before or after paren: `foo(bar, baz)`.\r\n* Keywords have space before paren: `if (foo)` etc.\r\n* In other matters, refer to http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html unless the surrounding code clearly and consistently disagrees.\r\n\r\n#### Javascript\r\n* Indentation: two spaces, no tabs.\r\n* No trailing whitespace, even on blank lines.\r\n* Follow http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml unless the surrounding code clearly and consistently disagrees.\r\n\r\nSome files in the project may not completely adhere to the above guidelines. Feel free to update any such files as you go.\r\n\r\n### Reporting issues\r\n\r\nIt's best to report issues in the correct GitHub repository. If in doubt, report to either the [tmc-server](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server) or the [tmc-netbeans](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-netbeans) repository.\r\n\r\nBefore reporting, please do a search to see if the issue has already been reported.\r\n\r\nFeature requests are also welcome in the issue tracker.\r\n\r\n### Testing someone's pull request\r\n\r\nTo apply someone's changes you need first to create a dedicated branch:\r\n``` shell\r\n$ git checkout -b testing_branch\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can use their remote branch to update your codebase. For\r\nexample, let's say the GitHub user `jamox` has forked and pushed to a\r\ntopic branch \"feature\" located at https://github.com/Jamox/tmc-server.\r\n``` shell\r\n$ git remote add jamox git://github.com/jamox/tmc-server.git\r\n$ git pull jamox feature\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember to run database migrations and recompile things as necessary.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
