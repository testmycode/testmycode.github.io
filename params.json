{"name":"TestMyCode","tagline":"","body":"Test My Code (\"TMC\") is a suite of tools that has been designed to make the life of programming instructors and students easier, as well as provide beneficial input for computing education researchers. \r\n\r\nInstructors benefit from the automatic bookkeeping facilities as well as the capability to build automated guidance into the programming assignments. By crafting most of the issues that students face into the tests as automated guidance, instructors can spend more face-to-face time explaining and helping students with more difficult concepts.\r\n\r\nStudents benefit from Test My Code as it provides support for downloading and submitting programming assignments directly from an IDE, removing the unnecessary steps related to manually downloading and uploading programming assignments. In addition, students' learning can be more productive thanks to instructional scaffolding from the tests within the programming assignments. When these two features are combined, students simply can program more during a given time frame, which is especially useful in introductory programming courses, where large parts of the students' struggle is related to applying and practising what they have just learned.\r\n\r\nResearchers benefit from the data that is gathered from the students' programming process. Test My Code provides a lightweight instrument for tracking students' programming process on a key press by key press -level. This provides unprecedented insight into the learning process.\r\n\r\nThe system has been used with great success by thousands of users at universities such as the [University of Helsinki](http://www.helsinki.fi/university/) and [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/). It is also the tool that enables many of the MOOCs offered at [http://mooc.fi](http://mooc.fi/).\r\n\r\n### The code\r\n\r\nAll of the code is available under https://github.com/testmycode\r\n\r\nThe main components are:\r\n* [The Server](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server)\r\n* [The NetBeans plugin](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-netbeans)\r\n* [The User-mode Linux sandbox for running submissions](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-sandbox)\r\n\r\nThe current maintainers are [@mpartel](https://github.com/mpartel) and [@jamox](https://github.com/jamox).\r\n\r\nIRC: #testmycode @ Freenode\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nGreat, you want to contribute! Welcome! :)\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug, please report it into the issues! Make sure that you include steps that are needed to reproduce the bug -- this makes hunting the bug down a lot more fun. In case of security issues or vulnerabilities, don't disclose those in public or in our issue trackers, but let the maintainers to know promptly.\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea for a new feature, we recommend that you discuss the idea with the maintainers of TMC on IRC at #testmycode @ Freenode. This helps you to avoid duplicate effort as your idea may be worked on elsewhere as well -- if no one is working on that feature, we can point you to the right component(s) for making the change.\r\n\r\nAfter that, just:\r\n\r\n1. Create a GitHub issue (or more) that describes your idea. The issue should be such that it can be completed based on the description. Provide pictures if needed.\r\n2. Find the correct [repository](https://github.com/testmycode) that you are going to work with.\r\n3. Set up a development environment as described in the README file of each project. All projects can be developed with the latest Ubuntu LTS. Other Linux distributions may require some fiddling with. Root permissions are required.\r\n4. Create a branch for your work. Use descriptive branch names.\r\n5. Create a pull request from your branch, start with *WIP:*. Remember to push changes frequently.\r\n6. Write the solution into your branch. Make sure to provide automated tests as well, and make sure that your tests cover your implementation (see e.g. [cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/)). Finally, check that your code follows the coding conventions described later in this document.\r\n7. *Before submitting or updating a pull request, run the entire test suite.* (We know it takes ages to run but it does catch a lot of bugs.)\r\n8. Let the reviewers know that your pull request is ready.\r\n\r\nMake sure to update your pull request early and frequently to provide us time to go through your changes and give feedback. When working on large changes, do them in small iterations so that you can receive periodical code reviews that can, if needed, also be merged at reasonable checkpoints.\r\n\r\n### Coding conventions\r\n\r\nMostly just try to stick to the style you see used in the project. Don't introduce new dependencies if close to same can be accomplished with existing dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Ruby\r\n* Indentation: two spaces, no tabs.\r\n* No trailing whitespace, even on blank lines.\r\n* Indent before private/protected.\r\n* Use Ruby >= 1.9 syntax for hashes. Prefer { a: :b } over { :a => :b }.\r\n* Prefer `&&` and `||` over `and` and `or`.\r\n* Prefer `extend self` over `def self.method` for modules.\r\n* Write method calls like `foo(bar, baz)` (parenthesis may be omitted in very clear cases, but it is not required)\r\n* Spaces around operators: `a = b + c`, not `a=b+c`.\r\n* Single-line blocks should use braces like this: `foo {|x| stuff(x) }`.\r\n* Multiline blocks should use `do |x|` syntax.\r\n\r\n#### Java\r\n* Indentation: four spaces, no tabs.\r\n* No trailing whitespace, even on blank lines.\r\n* No blank lines after method definitions ifs, whiles etc.\r\n* No unnecessary final attributes inside methods or for parameters\r\n* Method calls have no space before or after paren: `foo(bar, baz)`.\r\n* Keywords have space before paren: `if (foo)` etc.\r\n* In other matters, refer to http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html unless the surrounding code clearly and consistently disagrees.\r\n\r\n#### Javascript\r\n* Indentation: two spaces, no tabs.\r\n* No trailing whitespace, even on blank lines.\r\n* Follow http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml unless the surrounding code clearly and consistently disagrees.\r\n\r\nSome files in the project may not completely adhere to the above guidelines. Feel free to update any such files as you go.\r\n\r\n### Reporting issues\r\n\r\nIt's best to report issues in the correct GitHub repository. If in doubt, report to either the [tmc-server](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-server) or the [tmc-netbeans](https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-netbeans) repository.\r\n\r\nBefore reporting, please do a search to see if the issue has already been reported.\r\n\r\nFeature requests are also welcome in the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nYou are also very welcome to ask any questions or discuss ideas on IRC at #testmycode @ Freenode.\r\n\r\n### Testing a pull request\r\n\r\nFirst, create a branch to merge the changes into:\r\n``` shell\r\n$ git checkout -b testing_branch\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow merge their remote branch into your testing branch.\r\nFor example, let's say the GitHub user `jamox` has forked and pushed to a\r\ntopic branch \"feature\" located at https://github.com/jamox/tmc-server.\r\n``` shell\r\n$ git remote add jamox git://github.com/jamox/tmc-server.git\r\n$ git pull jamox feature\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember to run database migrations and recompile things as necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen you're done, switch back to the master branch and delete the testing branch.\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ git branch -D testing_branch\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
