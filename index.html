<ol>
<li>Create issue to spec either feature or fix to an issue. 
1.1 Before implementing a new feature ask for comments from maintainers before jumping and implementing it
A spec for the feature should be created prior to implementing it.</li>
<li>Fork correct TestMyCode repository</li>
<li>Set up development environment as described in each projects Readme.md.
Note that only general instructions are given.
All products can be developed with latest Ubuntu LTS. Root permissions may be required-</li>
<li>Create your own branch for your fix or feature. We prefer descriptive branch names.</li>
<li>Write the code and tests.</li>
<li><p>Remember to run whole test suite.</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Submit your pull request early to get feedback and new implementation ideas earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>For each pull request it often takes multiple iterations of code review
form maintainers so better to start early for the best developer experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually it takes at most two to three days for a code review, however
with bigger changes time might be longer.</p></li>
<li><p>During this progress we appreciate you to keep maintainers in loop with
your development and implementation. We may give you helpful tips during
the progress as well as early critique.
Especially when refactoring start by discussing about your idea with us.</p></li>

<h4>
<a name="ruby" class="anchor" href="#ruby"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ruby</h4>

<p>TMC-server and other ruby products follows a simple set of coding style conventions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two spaces, no tabs (for indentation).</li>
<li>No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.</li>
<li>Indent after private/protected.</li>
<li>Use Ruby &gt;= 1.9 syntax for hashes. Prefer { a: :b } over { :a =&gt; :b }.</li>
<li>Prefer &amp;&amp;/|| over and/or.</li>
<li>Prefer class &lt;&lt; self over self.method for class methods.</li>
<li>Use MyClass.my_method(my_arg) not my_method( my_arg ) or my_method
my_arg.</li>
<li>Use a = b and not a=b.</li>
<li>Prefer method { do_stuff } instead of method{do_stuff} for single-line
blocks.</li>
<li>Follow the conventions in the source you see used already.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a name="java" class="anchor" href="#java"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Java</h4>

<ul>
<li>Four spaces, no tabs (for indentation).</li>
<li>Follow the conventions in the source you see used already.</li>
<li>No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.</li>
<li>No blank lines after method definitions ifs, whiles etc.</li>
<li>No unnecessary final attributes inside methods or for parameters</li>
<li>No space between method name and opening parenthesis; one space between keywords like if, while, ... and opening parenthesis</li>
<li>Follow <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html</a> unless particular guidance overwritten here.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a name="javascript" class="anchor" href="#javascript"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Javascript</h4>

<ul>
<li>No tabs (for indentation).</li>
<li>No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml</a> unless particular guidance overwritten here.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above are guidelines - please use your best judgment in using them.
Most importantly keep using the same coding standards as already used in
that particular file. If particular file does not comply with guidelines above, feel free to update that file to comply with guidelines. </p>

<h3>
<a name="reporting-issues" class="anchor" href="#reporting-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting issues</h3>

<p>We accept only issues reported in GitHub. However before reporting issues to GitHub discussion with maintainers is advised.</p>

<p>Do a search in GitHub under Issues in case it has already been reported.
If you do not find any issue addressing it you may proceed to open a new
one. (In case of security issues, alert maintainers in private, don't
post it to out public issue tracker.)</p>

<p>Your issue report should contain a title and a clear description of the issue at the bare minimum. 
You should include as much relevant information as possible and should at least post a code sample that
demonstrates the issue or steps to reproduce the issue. 
It would be even better if you could include a unit test that shows how the expected behavior is not occurring. 
Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and figure out a fix.</p>

<h3>
<a name="creating-feature-requests" class="anchor" href="#creating-feature-requests"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating feature requests</h3>

<p>We accept also feature requests as issues reported in GitHub, the issue should clearly indicate that it is a feature request.</p>

<p>However it is suggested to first discuss with maintainers about your feature request to make sure creating new issue to GitHub.</p>

<h3>
<a name="testing-others-pull-requests" class="anchor" href="#testing-others-pull-requests"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing others pull requests</h3>

<p>To apply someone's changes you need first to create a dedicated branch:</p>

<pre lang="shell"><code>$ git checkout -b testing_branch
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use their remote branch to update your codebase. For
example, let's say the GitHub user Jamox has forked and pushed to a
topic branch "feature" located at <a href="https://github.com/Jamox/tmc-server">https://github.com/Jamox/tmc-server</a>.</p>

<pre lang="shell"><code>$ git remote add Jamox git://github.com/Jamox/tmc-server.git
$ git pull Jamox feature
</code></pre>

<p>After applying their branch, test it out!</p>
